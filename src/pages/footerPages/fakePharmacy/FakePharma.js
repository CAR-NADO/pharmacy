            sleeping pills, painkillers, and anti-anxiety tablets. Without a
            prescription, they are fake, leading to unavoidable health risks. As
            per some studies, numerous rogue suppliers are adopting different
            new techniques to draw the attention of people. Tricks such as
            positive online reviews and putting the website on the first page of
            the Google search engine are confusing the people.

            The truth is that these <span>online medical stores</span> are not
            registered with the independent regulator but registered to
            anonymous outside owners. The perils of buying medicines from such
            fraudulent online stores are that one has to suffer from devastating
            health implications in years to come. The providers emphasize mixing
            pills with chemicals, as a result, patients are likely to be
            vulnerable to unexpected health problems.

            regulatory agency to know everything related to packaging and
            authenticity. They are the ones that approve packaging and label
            information for medication with guidelines to help businesses and
            people to make safe use of medication.
